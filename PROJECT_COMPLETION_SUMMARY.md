## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Multithreading
- Thread creation and management
- Thread pools (ExecutorService)
- Thread coordination (join, CountDownLatch)
- Thread interruption

### Synchronization Techniques
- Synchronized methods
- ReentrantLock with tryLock
- Semaphores (fair and unfair)
- BlockingQueue
- ConcurrentHashMap

### Concurrency Issues Prevention
- **Deadlock**: Prevented using semaphores and resource ordering
- **Livelock**: Prevented using timeout with random backoff
- **Starvation**: Prevented using fair semaphores
- **Race Conditions**: Prevented using proper synchronization

### Design Patterns
- Producer-Consumer pattern
- Monitor pattern
- Delegation pattern
- Thread pool pattern
